**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Develop a high-performance Code Intelligence MCP Server that enables AI assistants to understand and query codebases through natural language."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an AI assistant integrated with development environments, I need to understand and query codebases through natural language so that I can provide intelligent code assistance, answer questions about code structure and dependencies, and help developers navigate and understand large codebases efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has a codebase with 10,000 files, **When** they ask "where is user authentication implemented?", **Then** the system returns relevant code locations with context within 200ms

2. **Given** a codebase has multiple API endpoints, **When** a developer queries "show all API endpoints that modify user data", **Then** the system identifies and lists all matching endpoints with their HTTP methods and paths

3. **Given** a complex data flow in the application, **When** asked to "trace the data flow from REST API to database", **Then** the system provides a complete path showing all intermediate transformations and handlers

4. **Given** a large monorepo with 100,000+ files, **When** the system performs initial indexing, **Then** it completes within 20 minutes and subsequent queries respond within 500ms

5. **Given** no internet connection available, **When** a developer uses the code intelligence features, **Then** all core functionality works using local resources only

### Edge Cases
- What happens when querying a codebase that is actively being modified?
- How does system handle corrupted or malformed source files?
- What happens when available memory is insufficient for the codebase size?
- How does the system respond to ambiguous natural language queries?
- What happens when file permissions restrict access to certain directories?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support natural language queries to search and understand codebases
- **FR-002**: System MUST index codebases supporting at least 15 programming languages
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract code entities (functions, classes, methods, imports, API endpoints, database queries)
- **FR-004**: System MUST build and maintain dependency graphs and call hierarchies
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide incremental indexing to handle file changes efficiently
- **FR-006**: System MUST operate fully offline without requiring internet connectivity
- **FR-007**: System MUST respond to queries within specified performance targets based on project size
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide semantic search capabilities beyond keyword matching
- **FR-009**: System MUST support multiple query intents (find code, explain functionality, trace data flow, find usage, audit security)
- **FR-010**: System MUST respect privacy with zero telemetry and no external data transmission by default
- **FR-011**: System MUST cache frequently accessed data for performance optimization
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide code complexity metrics and duplicate detection
- **FR-013**: System MUST expose functionality through MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
- **FR-014**: System MUST support configurable storage backends based on project size

- **SR-003**: System MUST sanitize file paths in all responses
- **SR-004**: System MUST support operation in completely isolated environments
- **SR-005**: System MUST respect all security-related file patterns (.env, secrets, keys)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Codebase**: A collection of source files in a project or repository, including metadata about size, languages, and structure
- **Code Entity**: A discrete element in code (function, class, method, variable, import, type) with its location, signature, and relationships
- **Index**: A searchable data structure containing parsed code entities, their embeddings, and relationships
- **Query**: A natural language or structured request to find or understand code, with intent and context
- **Dependency Graph**: Network of relationships between code entities showing imports, calls, and references
- **Embedding**: Vector representation of code for semantic similarity search
- **Cache Entry**: Stored result of expensive operations (parsing, embedding, query results) with TTL
- **Plugin**: Extension module adding support for languages, analyzers, or tools
- **Configuration**: User settings for performance, storage, model selection, and behavior
