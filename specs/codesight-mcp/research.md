# Research Findings: Code Intelligence MCP Server

**Generated**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Complete

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Hybrid Rust/TypeScript Architecture
**Decision**: Rust for performance-critical operations, TypeScript for MCP protocol
**Rationale**:
- Rust provides the performance needed for AST parsing and indexing at scale
- TypeScript has first-class MCP SDK support and ecosystem integration
- Napi-rs enables efficient FFI with zero-copy transfers between layers
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure TypeScript: Rejected due to insufficient performance for large codebases
- Pure Rust: Rejected due to limited MCP ecosystem support
- Go: Rejected due to less mature tree-sitter bindings

### 2. Tree-Sitter for Language Parsing
**Decision**: Tree-sitter with dynamically loaded grammars for 15+ languages
**Rationale**:
- Consistent AST representation across all languages
- Incremental parsing support for real-time updates
- Mature ecosystem with grammars for all target languages
- Error recovery allows parsing of incomplete/invalid code
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Language-specific parsers: Rejected due to maintenance overhead
- Regex-based parsing: Rejected as insufficient for semantic analysis
- LSP integration: Rejected due to runtime overhead and complexity

### 3. Vector Database Selection
**Decision**: DuckDB with VSS extension as primary, LanceDB as secondary
**Rationale**:
- DuckDB is embedded, eliminating network latency
- VSS extension provides HNSW indexing for fast similarity search
- SQL interface simplifies querying and joins with metadata
- ACID compliance ensures data consistency
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Faiss: Rejected due to lack of persistence and SQL interface
- Pinecone/Weaviate: Rejected as cloud-based (violates local-first)
- PostgreSQL+pgvector: Reserved for enterprise deployments only

### 4. Embedding Model Strategy
**Decision**: ONNX Runtime with tiered model selection
**Rationale**:
- ONNX enables cross-platform deployment with GPU acceleration
- all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384d) for speed-critical operations
- CodeBERT (768d) for accuracy-critical operations
- Local execution maintains privacy requirements
**Alternatives Considered**:
- OpenAI embeddings: Rejected due to external API dependency
- Custom trained models only: Rejected due to deployment complexity
- Single model: Rejected as it doesn't balance speed/accuracy tradeoffs

### 5. LLM Integration Architecture
**Decision**: Layered approach with local-first priority
**Rationale**:
- llama.cpp provides efficient GGUF model execution
- Ollama simplifies model management for users
- Free-tier APIs as fallback maintains accessibility
- Automatic fallback ensures reliability
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Cloud-only LLMs: Rejected due to privacy and offline requirements
- Single LLM provider: Rejected due to lack of flexibility
- No LLM integration: Rejected as it limits intelligence capabilities

### 6. Caching Architecture
**Decision**: Three-tier cache (in-process, Redis, RocksDB)
**Rationale**:
- L1 in-process cache eliminates network overhead for hot data
- L2 Redis enables distributed caching in scaled deployments
- L3 RocksDB provides persistent cache across restarts
- Content-based addressing for embeddings reduces duplication
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single-layer cache: Rejected as insufficient for performance goals
- Memory-only caching: Rejected due to cold start penalties
- File-based caching: Rejected due to poor concurrent access

### 7. Storage Backend Strategy
**Decision**: Pluggable backends based on project size
**Rationale**:
- SQLite for small projects (<10GB) - zero configuration
- PostgreSQL for enterprise - scalability and pgvector support
- DuckDB for analytics workloads - columnar storage benefits
- Abstraction layer enables backend switching without code changes
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single database for all: Rejected due to varying requirements
- NoSQL databases: Rejected due to lack of relational query support
- Custom storage engine: Rejected due to development overhead

### 8. Indexing Pipeline Design
**Decision**: Seven-stage parallel pipeline with work-stealing
**Rationale**:
- Parallel stages maximize CPU utilization
- Work-stealing ensures load balancing
- Progressive indexing provides early results
- Write-ahead logging ensures crash recovery
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Sequential processing: Rejected due to poor performance
- Two-phase indexing: Rejected as too coarse-grained
- Streaming pipeline: Rejected due to complexity for incremental updates

### 9. MCP Tool Design
**Decision**: Nine specialized tools with clear boundaries
**Rationale**:
- Each tool has a single responsibility
- Clear naming aids discoverability
- Separation enables independent testing and optimization
- Follows MCP best practices for tool design
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single omnibus tool: Rejected due to poor usability
- Fine-grained tools (20+): Rejected due to discovery overhead
- REST API only: Rejected as it doesn't leverage MCP benefits

### 10. Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-target deployment (binaries, containers, packages)
**Rationale**:
- Standalone binaries for easy installation
- Docker containers for consistent deployment
- Platform packages (npm, cargo, brew) for ecosystem integration
- Kubernetes support for enterprise scale
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Docker-only: Rejected as it limits adoption
- Source-only distribution: Rejected due to build complexity
- Cloud service: Rejected due to local-first requirement

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Memory Management
- **Memory pooling** for parser allocations to reduce GC pressure
- **Mmap** for large file access to avoid loading entire files
- **Streaming parsers** for processing files larger than memory
- **Bounded caches** with LRU eviction to control memory usage

### Concurrency Patterns
- **Tokio** for async I/O in Rust components
- **Rayon** for CPU-bound parallel processing
- **Work-stealing queues** for dynamic load balancing
- **Read-write locks** for index access patterns

### Network Optimization
- **Connection pooling** for all database connections
- **HTTP/2** for multiplexed API requests
- **Brotli compression** for API responses
- **Zero-copy transfers** via Napi-rs bindings

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Path canonicalization** to prevent traversal attacks
- **Input sanitization** using OWASP guidelines
- **Secure defaults** with opt-in for external services
- **Memory zeroization** for sensitive data

### Access Control
- **JWT with RS256** for stateless authentication
- **RBAC via Casbin** for fine-grained permissions
- **Rate limiting** per-client and global
- **Audit logging** for compliance requirements

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Property-based testing** for parsers using proptest/fast-check
- **Snapshot testing** for AST transformations
