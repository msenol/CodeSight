## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As an AI assistant integrated with development environments, I need to understand and query codebases through natural language so that I can provide intelligent code assistance, answer questions about code structure and dependencies, and help developers navigate and understand large codebases efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer has a codebase with 10,000 files, **When** they ask "where is user authentication implemented?", **Then** the system returns relevant code locations with context within 100ms (improved from 200ms with Rust FFI)

2. **Given** a codebase has multiple API endpoints, **When** a developer queries "show all API endpoints that modify user data", **Then** the system identifies and lists all matching endpoints with their HTTP methods and paths

3. **Given** a complex data flow in the application, **When** asked to "trace the data flow from REST API to database", **Then** the system provides a complete path showing all intermediate transformations and handlers

4. **Given** a large monorepo with 100,000+ files, **When** the system performs initial indexing, **Then** it completes within 15 minutes (improved from 20 minutes with Rust FFI) and subsequent queries respond within 250ms (improved from 500ms)

5. **Given** no internet connection available, **When** a developer uses the code intelligence features, **Then** all core functionality works using local resources only

6. **Given** a multi-language codebase with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Rust files, **When** the system indexes the codebase, **Then** it successfully parses and indexes entities from all supported languages

7. **Given** the Rust FFI bridge is unavailable, **When** a developer uses the code intelligence features, **Then** the system gracefully falls back to TypeScript-only implementation without functionality loss

### Edge Cases

- What happens when querying a codebase that is actively being modified?
- How does system handle corrupted or malformed source files?
- What happens when available memory is insufficient for the codebase size?
- How does the system respond to ambiguous natural language queries?
- What happens when file permissions restrict access to certain directories?
- How does the system handle Rust FFI bridge compilation failures?
- What happens when Tree-sitter parser grammars are missing for certain languages?
- How does the system behave when NAPI-RS native modules fail to load?
