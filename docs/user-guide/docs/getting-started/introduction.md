# Introduction

Welcome to the Code Intelligence MCP Server! This powerful platform revolutionizes how you interact with and understand your codebase by providing AI-powered code analysis, semantic search, and intelligent insights.

## What Makes It Special?

The Code Intelligence MCP Server stands out from traditional code analysis tools by combining:

- **AI-Powered Understanding**: Uses advanced language models to understand code semantics
- **Model Context Protocol**: Native integration with AI assistants like Claude
- **High-Performance Core**: Rust-based engine for lightning-fast analysis
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works across different programming languages
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Incremental indexing keeps your analysis up-to-date

## Core Components

### 🦀 **Rust Core Engine**
The heart of the system, built in Rust for maximum performance:
- **Tree-sitter Integration**: Advanced syntax parsing for multiple languages
- **Tantivy Search**: Full-text search with ranking and relevance
- **ONNX Runtime**: Machine learning inference for embeddings
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded analysis for large codebases

### 🔧 **TypeScript MCP Layer**
Provides the Model Context Protocol interface:
- **Tool Definitions**: Standardized tools for code analysis
- **Request Handling**: Manages communication with AI assistants
- **Response Formatting**: Structures results for optimal AI consumption
- **Error Management**: Robust error handling and recovery

### 🌐 **REST API Gateway**
Flexible HTTP interface for any client:
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Well-documented API endpoints
- **Authentication**: Secure API key-based access
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and health checks

```

### The Analysis Pipeline

1. **Code Ingestion**: Your codebase is scanned and parsed
2. **Syntax Analysis**: Tree-sitter extracts structural information
3. **Semantic Processing**: Code entities and relationships are identified
4. **Embedding Generation**: Vector representations for semantic search
5. **Index Storage**: Optimized storage for fast retrieval
6. **Query Processing**: Real-time search and analysis requests

## Supported Languages

The server supports analysis for multiple programming languages:

| Language | Parsing | Semantic Analysis | Embedding Support |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| TypeScript | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| JavaScript | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Python | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Rust | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Java | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| C++ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Go | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| C# | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ |

*✅ Full Support, ⚠️ Partial Support*
