## 4. User Interface Design

### 4.1 Design Style

- **Primary Colors**: Deep blue (#1e3a8a) for headers and primary actions, light blue (#3b82f6) for accents
- **Secondary Colors**: Gray scale (#f8fafc to #1e293b) for backgrounds and text, green (#10b981) for success states, red (#ef4444) for errors
- **Button Style**: Rounded corners (8px radius), subtle shadows, hover animations with color transitions
- **Font**: Inter for UI text (14px base), JetBrains Mono for code snippets (12px), clear hierarchy with font weights 400-600
- **Layout Style**: Clean card-based design, left sidebar navigation, responsive grid layouts, consistent 16px spacing
- **Icons**: Lucide icons for consistency, code-specific icons for file types, status indicators with color coding
