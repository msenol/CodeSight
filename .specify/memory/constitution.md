# Code Intelligence MCP Server Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Local-First Architecture
Core functionality works entirely offline with local LLMs (llama.cpp, Ollama, GGUF models).
Cloud services are optional enhancements only. All primary operations including code analysis,
indexing, and semantic search must function without network connectivity. External APIs may
only be used for supplementary features that gracefully degrade when unavailable.

**Rationale**: Privacy, security, and reliability demand that developers can trust their code
never leaves their machine unless explicitly configured. This ensures the tool remains useful
in air-gapped environments and respects intellectual property constraints.

### II. Performance at Scale
Handle monorepos with 100,000+ files while maintaining <500ms query latency for standard
operations. Rust core implementation for indexing operations. Parallel processing for all
analyzable workloads. Incremental updates to avoid full re-indexing. Memory-mapped files
and streaming parsers for large codebases.

**Rationale**: Modern software development involves increasingly large codebases. A tool that
slows down at scale becomes unusable precisely when it's needed most. Sub-second response
times are critical for maintaining developer flow state.

### III. Language Agnostic
Equal support for all programming languages via tree-sitter parsers. No hardcoded
language-specific logic in core systems. Plugin architecture for language-specific
extensions. Language detection must be automatic and accurate. All features must
gracefully handle polyglot repositories.

**Rationale**: Real-world projects mix multiple languages. Favoring certain languages
creates blind spots in understanding. Tree-sitter provides consistent AST parsing across
languages, enabling uniform analysis capabilities.

### IV. Privacy and Security
Zero telemetry by default. All code remains local unless explicitly configured for external
services. Respect .gitignore and security patterns automatically. No automatic external API
calls without user consent. Sensitive data detection and masking in any output. Clear audit
logs for any external communication when enabled.

**Rationale**: Code often contains secrets, proprietary algorithms, and sensitive business
logic. Trust requires absolute transparency about data handling. Security must be the
default, not an option.

### V. Incremental Intelligence
Progressive enhancement from simple grep to semantic search, with each layer independently
valuable. The architecture follows these layers:
1. Keyword search (ripgrep-based, regex support)
2. AST-based analysis (tree-sitter structural understanding)
3. Embedding-based semantic search (local vector models)
4. LLM-powered insights (local models for code understanding)

Each layer must function independently and add measurable value. Higher layers enhance but
never replace lower ones.

**Rationale**: Not all tasks require AI. Simple searches should remain simple and fast.
Complex analysis should be available when needed. This layered approach ensures the tool
remains useful even with minimal configuration while scaling up to advanced capabilities.

## Development Standards

### Testing Discipline
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory for all new features
- Unit tests required for all public APIs
- Integration tests required for cross-component interactions
- Performance regression tests for any code affecting query latency
- Property-based testing for parsers and analyzers

### Code Quality Requirements
- Rust code must pass clippy with zero warnings
- All public APIs must be documented with examples
- Memory usage must be bounded and predictable
- Error messages must be actionable, not just descriptive
- Benchmarks required for any performance-critical paths

## Architecture Guidelines

### Component Boundaries
- Core indexing engine in Rust (performance-critical)
- Language parsers via tree-sitter (consistency)
- Plugin system for extensions (flexibility)
- MCP protocol for IDE integration (standards-based)
- Local LLM interfaces via standard protocols (llama.cpp, Ollama)

### Data Flow Principles
- Streaming processing preferred over batch where possible
- Lazy evaluation for expensive computations
- Cache invalidation must be correct and minimal
- File watching for real-time index updates
- Concurrent readers with single writer for index access

## Governance

The Constitution supersedes all other project decisions and practices. Any deviation from
these principles requires explicit documentation with justification.

### Amendment Process
1. Proposed amendments must include rationale and impact analysis
2. Breaking changes to principles require migration plan
3. All amendments must maintain backward compatibility where possible
4. Version bumps follow semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: Removing or fundamentally changing principles
   - MINOR: Adding new principles or sections
   - PATCH: Clarifications and non-semantic improvements

### Compliance Verification
- All pull requests must verify constitutional compliance
- Architecture decisions must reference relevant principles
- Performance benchmarks must validate Principle II requirements
- Security audits must confirm Principle IV compliance
- New language support must follow Principle III guidelines

### Review Requirements
- Constitutional compliance is a blocking review requirement
- Violations must be explicitly justified and documented
- Complexity additions must demonstrate clear user value
- External dependencies must align with local-first principle
